### 😷 FaceMask-Detection-using-Deeplearning
A CNN based Image Classification model to classify people with and without masks.
A pilot project of Face mask detection. During the times of COVID-19, covering our face with a mask and maintaining social distancing is essential.  
With advancements in the field of Deep Learning, now we can easily train a model and check if someone is earning a mask or not.

### 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

#### Detecting faces with maks in video
1. Navigate to jupyter-notebook `./FaceMask Detection using Deep Learning.ipynb` <br>
**I made this file private to avoid misuse, contact me @v.snehith999@gmail.com for complete directory ☺**
2. Run import libraries cell and load model cell.
3. For getting real-time results, run predicition and casscade classifier cell

### 🧠 How it works!!
* Read input either as single image or video from webcam using OpenCV.
* Detect location of faces in given frame using Face_Frontal_Default Cascade Classifier.[Download](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml)
* Save the list of face portions for further steps.
* Load the Custom-trained CNN model, iterate each face through the model to predict mask on face.
* Post-process the frame ie; Tagging Face, with respective predictions.
